# a summary about you
summary: "I am a System Administrator with over 10 years experience in the industry. As I’ve transitioned away from user management and more towards server and remote service management, I have been trying to document as much as possible. I’m creating this blog to help collect my notes in a centralized place and to generally play around with new things.\n

At my workplace we work with a large variety of grant based projects that each warrant their own websites. My responsibilities are to deploy and manage the servers for these websites along with a few other web applications that we utilize, and to support our grant operations in the office. A lot of the documentation you find here is related to these processes but should be applicable for other web projects."
